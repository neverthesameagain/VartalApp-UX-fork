 * A thread-safe queue for network messages.

 * <p>This class wraps a {@link BlockingQueue} to provide a simple, thread-safe
 * FIFO mechanism for passing {@link SerializedAction} objects between the
 * network layer and the {@link ActionManager}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>This decouples the network I/O threads from the action processing thread.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Thread Safety:</b> This class is thread-safe.
 * It is internally backed by {@link LinkedBlockingQueue}.
